## Attempt to make a TWRP build for the A22 5G
### Should have said this months ago but the project is abandoned.

## Things to keep in mind if you want to maintain

Everything, I wasn't able to build it yet

Incorrect values in `BoardConfig.mk`, just don't know which

Possible things missing and incorrect directories in the `recovery.fstab`

Missing files that *might* be important
