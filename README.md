## Attempt to make a TWRP build for the A22 5G
Obviously not ready. I will most likely abandon this.
If you're lucky, I'll post it to XDA or something, but I'll still abandon it, I am not going to waste my time looking for bugs.
If you want to maintain it, go ahead, fork it and you have my unspoken permission.

## Things to keep in mind if you want to maintain

Everything, I wasn't able to build it yet

Incorrect values in `BoardConfig.mk`, just don't know which

Possible things missing and incorrect directories in the `recovery.fstab`
